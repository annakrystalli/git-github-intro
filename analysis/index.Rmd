- __Where to clone to:__ Select the folder where the repository will be hosted. Let's say _D:/GitHub_.
- __Repository to close:__ Here you will have a list of all the repositories you have access to and which you can clone. The repositories with the lock icon are _private_ repositories. We will talk about private repositories later. Let's say you choose the repository named _collaborative-github-exercise_.
- __Full path:__ Here GitKraken will show the full path where the repository will be cloned to. This will be _D:/GitHub/collaborative-github-exercise_.

- GitKraken tracks down all the history of the cloned repo. All the changes and by who they were made are shown in great detail.

- This is how the folder you have selected to host your cloned repository will look like.



## Initialize a repository using GitKraken

- __Account:__ In which account you want the repository to be created to. This can be your account or an organization that you have access to.
- __Name:__  The name of the repository let's say _mytest_.
- __Description:__ Optional, but every repository should have a small description!
- __Access:__ Public or Private.
- __Clone after init:__ This checkbox tells GitKraken to run the clone procedure we did before after creating the new repository.
- __Where to clone to:__ Select the folder where the repository will be hosted if selected to be cloned. Let's say again _D:/GitHub_.
- __Full path:__ This should now be _D:/GitHub/mytest_
- __License:__ A license is mainly a list of permissions that other people who want to use your code can do. For example you may want others to use your code but only if they accredited you. [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) can help you choose the right license. For open source repositories MIT and GNU GPLv3 are usually appropriate licenses.
