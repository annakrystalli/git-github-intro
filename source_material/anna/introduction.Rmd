## Why are we here?

### The paper is the advertisement


> “an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the **full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.**”

*John Claerbout paraphrased in [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)*

### [The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)
Here's what's next

## Reproducibility/Replicability crisis

- Many issues statistical and a results of broken Academic incentive systems.

- Much can be tackled by transparency and better computational literacy.

### [Reproducible Research in Computational Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226)
ROGER D. PENG, SCIENCE 02 DEC 2011 : 1226-1227

> Reproducibility has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible.

## Reinventing Discovery -> Open Sourcing science


- Sharing resources
- Collective intelligence
- Mass collaboration

## **The grand vision**

### Hans Rosling on open data (and data science) back in 2006

> How do we get there?

## **21st Century Research meta-responsibilities**

Better digital curation of the workhorses of modern science: **code** & **data**

- accessible
- reusable
- searchable
<center>
<h3><b>We all need to do our bit</b></h3>

## **Drivers of better digital management**

- Funders: value for money, impact, reputation
- Publishers: many now require code and data.
    + Specialist journals for **software** (e.g [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) and **data** (e.g. [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)) have emerged.
- Your wider scientific community
- PIs, Supervisors and immediate research group

---

### **Yourselves!**
**Be your own best friend:**

> **aim to create secure materials that are [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)**
> *findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable*


- Think about traceablility and provencance
- Follow community conventions
- Prepare it to share it

## Back to "Why are we here?"


- To help you make the most of the real workhorses of your work, **YOUR CODE & DATA**!

- To help you be empowered by modern tools & technologies rather than be overwhelmed by them

- To help you lead the culture change rather than be burdened by increased requirements

- Ultimately, to **change how science works for better for everyone**!

## BES guide to reproducible code 

<img src="https://methodsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/code-cover.jpg?w=424&h=600" height=300px>

A Guide to Reproducible Code covers all the basic tools and information you will
need to start making your code more reproducible. We focus on R and Python, but
many of the tips apply to any programming language.

# Before we dive in

- I've tried to focus on concepts and tools that I wish I knew when I started

- I will try and give a broad overview rather that dig too deeply

- PLEASE STOP ME if I use jargon you don't understand or need some clarification.
